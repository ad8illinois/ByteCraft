See gh-18197, we currently clear almost all errors that occur when fetching obj.__array_interface__ or just obj.__array__. There is little use for this, since by definition AttributeError can be raised if an object actually wants the error to be ignored. Shapely dependend on this (raising a NotImplementedError).

We should deprecate ignoring these errors entirely. There are more similar cases, although this issue is about the interface/array path.

(Will assign myself, but if anyone wants to look at it, feel free)
