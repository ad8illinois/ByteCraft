The linalg.solve() documentation gives a misleading way to check that its result is correct. Quoting from the doc:

 >>> a = np.array([[3,1], [1,2]])
 >>> b = np.array([9,8])
 >>> x = np.linalg.solve(a, b)
 >>> x
 array([ 2.,  3.])
Check that the solution is correct:

 >>> (np.dot(a, x) == b).all()
 True
Although this works with the above example, the test won't work in general due to rounding errors.

As this is certainly one of the most used functions in numerical computing, likely used by untrained users, it should be stated more correctly:

Check that the solution is correct:

>>> (np.dot(a, x) -  b).sum()
0.0

I think this issue can be closed as the docs right now use

>>> np.allclose(np.dot(a, x), b)
True
which is the same as proposed. However, the usage of allclose function might be confusing for new users.
