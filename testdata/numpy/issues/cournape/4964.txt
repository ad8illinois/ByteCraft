@cournape It seems like bld.env.HAS_CBLAS is never true. The build output also shows a failure to find atlas.

On what platform are you seeing that? I've never noticed.

Fedora 20, waf-1.7.13, bento master. It fails both with/without site.cfg. Setup.py works by default without site.cfg.

Bit of googling reveals this. I have no idea what the current state of bento is in this regard, but it doesn't seem there yet.

Doesn't work with waf-1.7.16 either, and crashes with waf-1.8.0-pre after failing to find ATLAS.

minor versions of waf are generally not API compatible, so using waf 1.8.0 is not expected to work.

As for site.cfg, bento does not look at it, so that's expected as well.

I don't have a recent linux handy right here, but can confirm it works as expected on os x at least (_dotblas is built). I will look at it during euroscipy sprints.

It works on travis (ubuntu), so the problem is probably fedora specific. Note that 64 bit fedora has a different library directory layout than ubuntu (debian). Waf 1.8.0-pre crashes bento ;)

some bento build details seem outdated scipy/scipy#3978

Bento will be gone in Numpy 1.11, so closing this.
