Yogi:
- Keep looking at Github's API
  - Can we read all the issues for a project at once?
  - Setting up webhooks?

Ben:
- Implement euclidean distance. HAve both? And maybe see if we perform any better with one or the other
- Create some structure for defining a topic, and what docs are in it, creating unigram LM for each topic? (for naive bayes, not for KNN)


- Implement TF-IDF transforms on our TF-vectors (Shivani)


- Implement Jelenik-Mercer smoothing, Dirichlet ??? (psuedo counts) (Annamika)

- Implement classification methods:
  - KNN? - nltk has one out of the box (Annamika)
  - Naive Bayes?  (Shivani)


STRETCH GOALS:
- Add an issue-duplicate detection CLI. Compares tf-vectors and reutsn any that have similiary > a threshold
- Deploy this code, and maybe wrap it in an API
    - Dockerize
- Add a real database, instead of storing everything in memory / in text file


- Make a pretty CLI for taking one or more issues, downloading them, then classifying them
- Documentation
